# License
HotLog.pas is a Delphi unit which groups object definitions, routines, aso in order to fully manage a log file for you.
It has been written with Delphi 6 (PE).

Licence
This unit is freeware, but under copyrights that remain mine for my parts of the code, and original writers for their parts of the code. This is mainly the case about "variant open array parameters" copying routines, that come from Rudy Velthuis' pages on the web at http://rvelthuis.bei.t-online.de/index.htm.
This unit can be freely used in any application, freeware, shareware or commercial. However, I would apreciate you sending me an email if you decide to use it. Of course, you use it under your own and single responsability. Neither me, nor contributors could be held responsible for any problem resulting from the use of this unit.  ;-)
It can also be freely distributed, provided all this licence remain within it unchanged, and that the readme.txt and this help file are distributed with it too.

Latest version, bug corrections, aso are available at http://mapage.noos.fr/qnno/pages/delphi_fr.htm
