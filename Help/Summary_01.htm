<p>The v 2.0 of HotLog gives you the possibility to define a maximum size 
for the log file. Once this maximum is reached, HotLog's instance will
close it's file, and open a new one. This "most wanted feature" has
been added by Robert Becker. Many thanks go to him.
<br>
In order to find more about this new feature, please go to the <a href="FileStp_05a.htm#LogFileMaxSize">Log
file definition</a> page.
</p>
<p>v 2.1 is an extention of v 2.0 by Femi
Fadayomi, adding the support for Delphi 5 (See readme.txt
file for D5 install).
</p>
<p>v 2.2, by Luis Gonzalo Constantini Von Rickel, enhances the
management
of the memo used for the visual feedback, and fixes a possible AV when
creating the log file.<br>

<div class="ident">
<p>HotLog.pas is a Delphi unit which groups object definitions,
routines,
aso in order to fully manage a log file for you.
<br>
It has been written with Delphi 6 (PE).
</p>
<p><b>Licence</b>
<br>
This unit is freeware, but under copyrights that remain mine for my
parts of
the code, and original writers for their
parts of the code. This is mainly the case about "variant open array
parameters" copying routines, that come from Rudy Velthuis'
pages on the web at <a href="http://rvelthuis.bei.t-online.de/index.htm">
http://rvelthuis.bei.t-online.de/index.htm</a>.
<br>
This unit can be freely used in any application, freeware, shareware or
commercial. However, I would apreciate
you sending me an email if you decide to use it. Of course, you use it
under your own and single responsability.
Neither me, nor contributors could be held responsible for any problem
resulting from the use of this unit.&nbsp; ;-)
<br>
It can also be freely distributed, provided all this licence remain
within
it unchanged, and that the readme.txt and this help file are
distributed with it too.

<div class="ident">

<ul type="disc">
  <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">Multithreaded, object oriented,
buffered safe. The log file will
be correctly written
to disk, even if your application crashes. The
logging/parsing/formating and optionnal
visual feedback work don't consume your main thread's time. You can use
as many instances of THotLog as you want.</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">Management of the log file itself
    <ul>
      <li>Path, name, extention (including [optional] generation 
(".001", ".002", ...) based ones)</li>
      <li>Access (openning, writting, closing) and dealing with older 
version(s) when generations are used)</li>
      <li><b>Ability to close the log file when it reaches a certain size
limit, then open a new one.</b></li>
      <li>Any default value / behaviour can be easily changed</li>
    </ul></li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">Fully "automated": The logging object instance is
created at your application start-up, you can use it directly if you
decide to change none of the default settings. Similarly, everything is
freed when needed. However, any setting can be changed either before
beginning to logg, and/or (for some of them) during run-time.</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">Provides means of easily retrieving informations
about the environment your user is actually working with, in order to
facilitate debugging, in case of need. These informations
include numbers and facts about the operating system, the memory, the
system's timing accuracy, and much more</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">Provides easy-to-use strings formating capabilities, to have your
logs presented cleanly</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">Ability to output detailed informations in case of
exceptions occuring, includding the ability to deal with 
"variant open array parameter" (thanks Rudy
V.): All you have to do is to give the exceptions logging methodes
some datas like they are (for example the list of the parameters
received by the function), without wondering whether they are integers or strings,
valid pointers, uninitialized or dangling ones, aso. The log object instance will
mind his own business with all that stuff</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">Can be assigned a memo, in order to provide your user visual
feedback</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">Provides code timing features too, with a resolution going from
seconds to nanoseconds, and from ticks to cycles depending on your user's
computer, and the timer you choose</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">Many options are available, to allow you to change HotLog's
default behaviour</li>
  <li>More, and more, ...</li>
</ul>

<p>Many thanks go to all the people who encouraged me, and more
particularly to those who contibuted to HotLog evolution:
<br></p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">Femi Fadayomi, who did add Delphi 5
support.</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">Robert Becker
(rbecker@compuserve.com), who brought to us, hLog users, what
was certainly the "most wanted" feature : HotLog can now be limited in
size, and automatically opens a new file when a certain size limit
isreached.</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">Guillaume Cornu, for
fixing the GetRegValue() function</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">Oleg Danilov,
who added the SetMemoLimit() procedure</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">Luis Gonzalo Constantini Von Rickel,
who did a great fix in the FileCreate()
function, and worked a lot on the visual feedback part</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">Vittorio Loschi, who corrected the
buggy SetFileName() procedure</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">"Sergueï" who
fixed a sometimes incorrect initialization</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">Jean-Philippe R. who tracked and
fixed a bug occuring in "append" mode</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you to all of you!</p>
